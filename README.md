# lru-cache

This is a Golang-Fiber Api that implements a Least Recently Used Cache. It is a simple implementation of a cache that stores key-value pairs. The cache has a maximum capacity and when the cache is full, the least recently used key-value pair is removed to make space for the new key-value pair.
